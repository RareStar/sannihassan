         The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along.

         If you are seeking, seek us with joy. For we live, in the kingdom of joy. Do not give your heart to anything else but to the love of those who are clear joy.

         Love isn't the work of the tender and the gentle; 
         love is the work of wrestlers. 
         The ones who becomes a servant of lovers is really 
         a fortunate sovereign.
